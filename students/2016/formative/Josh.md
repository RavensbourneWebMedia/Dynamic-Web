***

**Name**: Josh van Niekerk

**Student No**: 96293615

**Course**: BA (HONS) Web Media, Level 2.

**Unit Code**: WEB14203

### Introduction

I feel that this unit has been very beneficial to me. I've learnt new methods and techniques which I'll be able to implement into future projects. I have really enjoyed this project so far and have found it very interesting. The feedback I've received from my peers from my presentation has helped me to pinpoint my app. It was also interesting to hear their concepts and giving constructive feedback. This made me query certain aspects of my own project. The blogs have also helped me to reflect on what I've learnt each week.
