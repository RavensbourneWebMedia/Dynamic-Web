##Introduction
During this term we designed a template for a web app, then chose an idea and built up the template around that. For my web app I tried to improve upon Ravensbourne Connect by creating Connect Online.

I also considered the fact that a lot of the people using this app could be using mobile, so I included some mobile css to ensure it's usable on mobile.
